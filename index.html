        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>    I am Murali Ganesh Peddireddy, a dynamic and results-oriented chemical engineering professional with a robust academic background and hands-on experience in the petroleum refining industry. I hold an MS in Chemical Engineering from the State University of New York, Buffalo, and a B.Tech in Chemical Engineering from SRM Institute of Science and Technology, India. <p>
        <p>    During my tenure at Nayara Energy Limited in Jamnagar, India, I started as a Graduate Engineer Trainee and was later promoted to Assistant Manager, where I oversaw operations in the Vacuum Gas Oil Unit, including the Delayed Coker Unit. My responsibilities included managing operations during refinery turnarounds and handling emergency situations, which earned me recognition for a seamless start-up of critical equipment. I have also gained valuable experience as an Industrial Trainee at Technior India Engineering and Mayura Industries, where I contributed to pipeline infrastructure projects and gained hands-on experience in the production of palm oil and biodiesel. <p>
        <p>    My academic and professional journey has equipped me with proficiency in simulation tools such as Unisim and Aspen, along with programming languages like Matlab, C, and Python. I am committed to continuous learning and innovation, as evidenced by my coursework and participation in various certificate programs, including Six Sigma and Quantum Mechanics. Beyond my professional endeavors, I am passionate about organizing technical events and contributing to the community. I have served as the Head of the Technical domain in 'The SRM Chemical Club' and as the Graphic Design Coordinator for the Chemflux 8.0 Conference, where I designed promotional materials and visual content. <p>
        <p>    With a blend of technical expertise, practical experience, and a passion for innovation, I am eager to contribute to challenging chemical engineering projects and make a meaningful impact in the field.</p>
